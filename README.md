👋 About Me
I'm a passionate and results-driven Developer with a love for creating innovative, human-centered solutions. I thrive on turning complex ideas into clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications that tackle real-world challenges.

🔭 I’m currently working on Sahara, a voice-enabled, empathetic AI companion designed to provide a safe and anonymous space for the youth of India to discuss mental wellness.

🌱 I'm just beginning my journey into the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I'm focused on learning the fundamentals of topics like Natural Language Processing (NLP) to apply to my projects.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to mental health tech, AI for social good, and voice-based applications.

🤔 I’m looking for help with understanding the core concepts of machine learning and finding great beginner-friendly resources.
